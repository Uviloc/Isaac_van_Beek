          <p>
            I always wanted to create some type of art, and after considering my options I ended up choosing pixel art.<br>
            It always interested me, and I love how it looks.<br>
            <br>
            The idea was to have each piece increase in complexity; I also increased the canvas size for each piece.<br>
            To account for the increase in size I also increased how much time I would spend on each.<br>
            I set out these maximum times to not focus on one piece too much, but also to show improvements in the next piece instead of the previous.
            This does mean that I will end up with pieces that have many possible improvements to them.<br>
            <br>

        <h2>Step 1: Crate</h2>
        <div class="media-area [positionClass]" style="--contentSize: 60%">
          
          <p>
            First of I followed <a href="https://youtu.be/Ep-_nJNHPc4?feature=shared">this tutorial</a> that showed the basics of Aseprite.
            I wanted to create a crate to start simple.<br>
            My goal was to also use all the tricks that I learned from the tutorial on what hotkeys to use.
            This would allow me to learn it correctly at the start rather than halfway through needing to change my methodology.
          </p>
          <img class="media" src="media/Crate.png" alt="Crate Pixel Art">
          <p>
            I learned the basics of Aseprite such as the controls, the workflow and some of the rules that are used to create pixel art.
            These rules will need to be remembered for the second step, as that is where they will be applied further and without guidance.<br>
            <br>
            After the first piece that I made I was able to tell a little bit of my own shortcomings.<br>
            One was that I don’t have an art background and that is most apparent in my use of colours and lack of knowledge about lighting,
            perspective and other primary skills that many artists have but I as a designer miss.<br>
            I am aware that these skills require not only knowledge but also a lot of practice.
            Therefore, this is something I will make an effort in with the future pieces.
            But I do not expect myself to master anytime soon let alone inside this portfolio piece.

              The highlighting was something I struggled with during the creation and I was not able to get it right,
              so I wanted to look more at how highlights were done after this piece.
              I do like that it gets the point across, but it feels quite harsh and flat.
              The number is also rotated wrong and feels off because of it.<br>
              It for sure looks like a pool ball, and for my first piece, I am not upset about it, but there are a ton of things to improve on it.

              I learned a neat trick for creating an inner shadow.<br>
              By having specific layers on, after creating an ellipse to mask part of it, then setting the fill to respect all active layers,
              the fill will only do the part between the drawn ellipse and the base layer that was selected.

            <p>
              I had less trouble on this piece then the previous pool ball.<br>
              I feel like I understood the controls much better and was able to apply some of the lessons I learned from then.
              Such as the highlight, which works very nicely.<br>
              I do feel like the pumpkin could be better in terms of its grooves.
              It could possibly be the fact they the outline of the pumpkin makes them look a bit weird as it interferes with the direction of the groves.
              Possibly having a darker and lighter part of the grooves and the surrounding pumpkin sections, will make them look more inset.<br>
              I both like and dislike the background I made, the idea is nice, and the ground texture works somewhat,
              but the sky feels plain in comparison, while the ground could be a bit too busy.
              The harsh transition between them just does not work at all and feels unrealistic.
              I can also improve the stem giving it its own inner shadow.<br>
              <br>
              I also noticed that I was able to make better use of hotkeys and different tool/tool settings.
              I actively tried to not click on tools but instead use their hotkeys so that I build up muscle memory before I get used to clicking on tools.<br>
              Comparing it to my pool ball I can also tell then the lighting is much better.<br>
              The little trick to create an inner shadow will be one to remember and the highlight is so easy, it’s hard to not put it on all future pieces.<br>
              <br>
              When I later talked with a pixel art teacher he pointed out that the grooves should have anti-aliasing to make them less harsh and inset them better.

        <h2>Step 4: Tree</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 40%">
          <div style="overflow-y: auto; scrollbar-color: #989898 #00000000;">
          <p>
            Before I had a plan, I felt the most anxious for the tree.<br>
            I had no clue where to begin, and it felt like a difficult thing to get right.
            Trees are complex but still have rules to them. People don’t think about these rules, but subconsciously they can tell when one is not followed in a painting.<br>
            When thinking about a good way to start off, I simply thought to make big shapes to start with getting the proportions correct.
            Basically, doing the same as I did with the previous artworks, but this time without using these shapes in the final result.<br>
            <br>
            As soon as I started, I knew that this was going to be difficult.<br>
            The canvas size was now 128x128 and it certainly had an impact on the difficulty for me.<br>
            Things just didn’t feel right, and I felt like every line I made wasn’t correct.<br>
            So, I took a bit of a break and looked at pixel art of trees with the same canvas size. I also watched a bunch of different tutorials on pixel art trees.<br>
            This led me to make a new plan guided mostly from <a href="https://youtu.be/VLuKpgkOuKM?si=0yjvGYhHmGUUL5km">this tutorial</a>.<br>
            <br>
            I made my plan as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>Create trunk and branches using new method with 3D shaped pipes</li>
              <li>Dig the pipes underground for roots</li>
              <li>Outline the leave coverage (have some gaps that show nice parts of the branches)</li>
              <li>Put in light on one side of leaves</li>
              <li>Add in small individual leaves in some places in the outline to break it up include the leaves into the light cover as well</li>
              <li>Add in darker leave colours at the bottom, lighter at the top</li>
              <li>Add in bark texture with panels that cover the pipes of the trunk</li>
              <li>Final detailing pass</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            
            I also thought and found of new techniques to use for some of these steps:
            <ul>
              <li>Sphere brush to lay the pipes, (alternate with left and right mouse button to get 3d shape) (Own idea)</li>
              <li>Use selection to shade (Taken from <a href="https://youtu.be/BYsLckeFXJQ?si=qD1B9duRU7k91WFs&t=316">this tutorial</a>)</li>
              <li>Custom leave brush making (Taken from <a href="https://youtu.be/d5bCr0i31T0?si=kJxHOvfGM7bD6yVt&t=124">this tutorial</a>)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h2>The Result:</h2>
        <div class="media-area topRight" style="--contentSize: 30%">

          <p>
            I am decently happy with the result. I can definitly see tons of parts that I do not like but given the fact that this was the hardest work so far,
            I can see a huge improvement over how it all started.
            A pixel art teacher gave me some good points for next work, such as more layering in the leaves.
            Building the tree up with 3D balls of cotton that become the leaves. Doing multiple layers of this to create the result.
            This would definitly make the tree much more dimensional, which I find to be lacking in the current tree.
            There are also some things that I do like about the tree, such as the small leaves that surround the canopy,
            they came out quite well and the layout of the branches worked nicely as well.
            The bark texture can see much improvement, but I do think there is potential in the techniques I applied.
            I decided not to spend a huge amount of time extra on the current tree as I was already over my time limit that I set out.

          <h2>Reflection & Final Thoughts:</h2>
          <p>
            When I started this project, I expected to have greater difficulty compared to traditional art. But for some reason I enjoy the process of pixel art a lot more. The simplistic nature and the creative problem solving feels more ingrained into the process and makes it more fun.
            Eventhough, I expected pixel art to bring out much more of my perfectionistic nature, it somehow didn’t. The only theory I have on this is that when I draw a line for traditional art, I feel like all the 8.000 pixels are in the wrong spot, while with pixel art, it is generally just 4 pixels being wrong.
            I can tell that this is something I will continue working on in my spare time, especially as I can see that more practice is needed at this point.
