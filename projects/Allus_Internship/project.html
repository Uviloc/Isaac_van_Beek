    For my first internship I worked at Allus Broadcast Facilities, a company focussing on the broadcasting of sport events.
    
    During my time there I was tasked with creating an interface that would trigger live graphics using the xPression API.
    This led me to create a modular framework with a focus on reliability and beginner friendly.

          <p>
            For my first internship I worked at Allus Broadcast Facilities, a company focussing on the broadcasting of sport events.<br>
            During my time there I was tasked with creating an interface that would trigger live graphics using the xPression API.

        <h2>The previous Generation</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 70%">
          <p>
            I was given this task along side some code that they made before, their code was outdated and had some issues but also was not made with compatibility in mind. 
            Therefore, each sport had their own interface.<br>
            <br>
            I first set out a design requirements document that would outline all the features and how each function would be coded.<br>
            After having gotten approval from my company coach I set out to build the framework.

            <ul>
              <li>Versitile (Able to link with any graphics program)</li>
              <li>Beginner friendly (No knowledge is needed in programming or the system itself)</li>
              <li>Robust (Any errors need to be prevented and warned before they happen)</li>
              <li>No delay (Should add as little delay as possible from pressing a button to seeing the graphic)</li>
              <li>Modular (Able to keep every part of the process in one application)</li>
              <li>Future proof (Should still be usefull in future developments in technologie, with minimal changes in code)</li>
              <li>Quick setup (Should take only about 30 minutes to create a new form)</li>

        <h2>The start</h2>
        <div class="media-area top" style="--contentSize: 75%">
          <p>
            I followed the example of the previous application and started making my interface in WinForms, a C# based program builder.
          </p>
          <img class="media" src="media/Custom Properties.png" alt="Custom Properties in WinForms">
          <p>
            My idea was to create one interface that would work for all sports.<br>
            I kept my end user in mind throughout this process. As the end users would be non-coders, I wanted to keep down any coding wherever possible.
          </p>

        <h2>SQL databases</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 75%">
          <p>
            Besides making the interface for my app I also had to implement other features such as databases for keeping scores and teams:<br>
          </p>
          <img class="media" src="media/Databases.png" alt="Loading databases with SQL">
          <p>
            Using SQLite had its difficulties as I first wanted to give the user the possibility of changing the columns, something that SQLite is not capable of doing.<br>
            So, after seeing what was possible, I reeled these ideas back as they were not fully required.</p>

        <h2>Modular Structure code</h2>
        <div class="media-area top" style="--contentSize: 83%">
          <img class="media" src="media/Clear coding structure.png" alt="Code for Modular Loading">
          <p>
            I made a simple modular style architecture, where the user could create a new interface using a pre-made template and put this in a folder to have it loaded.<br>
            This vastly reduced the amount of duplicate code.

        <h2>Fail safe</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 70%">
          <p>
            A similar thing was made for each component that the user needed to interact with.
            By doing so the end user did not have to look at any code and if something broke there would only be one function that was the issue.

        <h2>Interface</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 84%">
          <p>
            This got a lot of positive reactions when I showed the various features and how it allowed the company to very easily work with my application.<br>
            What would have taken them weeks or even months to create a new interface, they could now do within one day.

          <p>
            Sadly, I wasn&#39;t able to fully complete the program as I had started late with my internship.<br>
            This meant that in the end I had to leave the program around 75% completed.<br>
            Still this internship was a massive learning experience for me, and I was able to make a lot of great connections though them.
