            A multiplayer game about witches racing on hovercrafts through a swamp.<br>
            This was my first experience with the Unreal engine with a project lasting 10 weeks in a team of 8 where I had not worked with any of its members before.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Witchraft was a joint project made during a course at Creative Media &amp; Game Technologies. Made in a group of 8 (2 designers, 4 artist, 2 engineers),
            the project was made in Unreal Engine 5.2.<br>
            This was my first experience with Unreal, so there were many unforeseen problems that I encountered. The project spanned a total of 10 weeks and only
            a couple of people had experience in Unreal. In the end I would not recommend doing this project in Unreal if it wasn&#39;t for all the experience
            I learned along the way.<br>
            The project was our first time working with and for a client. However we did not really notice much of a difference in the way we approached to project.
            Since despite a lot of trying we were often ignored or given very little feedback by our client.<br>
            <br>
            As is with many group projects there were a lot of issues. Some caused by miscommunication, others caused by simple inexperience in the engine.
            Such as all the issues that came along with using Git for Unreal.<br>
            This caused a lot of delays and we ended up having to scrap certain parts of the original concept. For instance,
            there was a plan to have the buildings explode on impact.<br>
            However the Chaos System (from Unreal) was having too many issues and we decided it to not
            be worth solving the numerous issues.

        <h2>Procedural Foliage in Unreal</h2>
        <div class="media-area bottom" style="--contentSize: 89%">
          <p>
            I was personally responsible for the designing and building of the level.<br>
            I used the procedural generator offered by Unreal to plant the vegetation.

          <p>
            At first the idea was to create more of a closed loop with a couple of branches. The idea that many in our group wanted was to have it almost be a maze.<br>
            I personally do not like confusion as a game aspect, but I do like chaos as a game aspect.<br>
            However during the first testing phase we quickly realized that this was just too much for the players to keep track of.<br>
            So I simplified the map significantly by having a straight path without incorrect choices.<br>
            This, during playtesting, worked much better in terms of guiding the player to the finish.

          <p>
            In the end I learned a lot about Unreal. Mostly in terms of the level editor, but I also made a volumetric fog texture with the materials.<br>
            I used Substance Designer textures with its respective plugin and I also fixed some bugs in the blueprints, that the engineers didn't have the time for.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div class="media-area">
          <p>
            An interesting aspect about me is that I do have experience in both designing, coding and a bunch in between.<br>
            I only code mostly as a hobby so I would not be able to replace an actual engineer.<br>
            I don&#39;t have experience in art, but I do always try to understand how things work in their field.<br>
            Because of this I am able to give another view and am able to brainstorm with a lot of people in different fields.<br>
            I often find solutions and the reasons behind bugs, that the engineers haven&#39;t been able to solve.<br>
            Like the fact that player 2 would disappear when player 1 moved too far.<br>
            I immediately though it could be related to the world partitioning we had in place. And low and behold, it was.<br>
            <br>
            I was also appointed the project leader. This is not something too new to me, as I often end up leading all the projects in my study.
            I generally have a good and quick grasp on how people work and what they are good with.<br>
            And although I have many parts to improve in I always try to resolve problems in the group by looking at the situation from an objective perspective.<br>
            <br>
            This project was quite difficult for me in this role however.<br>
            This was due to me only knowing 2 of the members, while I never worked with any of them.<br>
            So it was hard to keep the entire group together as many members were getting irritated with the project, the client and others.<br>
            It certainly did not help that some of the members were only complaining and borderline insulting others.<br>
            Looking back I really should have stopped this behavior from happening, as it would have improved the overall mood in the end.<br>
            <br>
            I spend by far the most hours into this project. Mostly due to me working on a lot of the various tasks that nobody else really took up.<br>
            Like testing, communication with the client, prototyping and creating the presentations. Although that last one I liked to do anyways.<br>
            Since I have a bunch of experience in PowerPoint, I often go a bit of an extra mile on the presentations, which is why
            I created almost all presentations during my study.
