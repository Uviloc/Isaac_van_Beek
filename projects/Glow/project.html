    One of the very first games I made still holds up in my opinion. Although I might be a bit biased.

    In this game you simply have to catch fireflies as a fox.
    While avoiding bats you can set your high score higher and higher with
    the free play mode, while the timed mode tests your speed rather than your accuracy.

            Glow is a game I made for one of the first subjects given at the Creative media and Game Technologies. At this time, I did not have much knowledge on many Game Design principles, so if I would remake this game right now, I would definitely do things differently in terms of movement, user feedback and the noticeability of the enemy bat.

            Yet despite all this whenever I play Glow, I really enjoy it.
It’s a simple concept, which is something I often strafe for, as simple games appeal to me a lot more then games that take months to just understand the various parts of it.

            The game was made in Processing since this was the requirement of the subject, yet I tried to push my own knowledge and skills at many points.
Like save files and more complex enemy movement. These were not requirements, nor were they function that were taught in class, yet I still implemented them.

            I still often see myself doing such above and beyond moves every now and then. It does at times get in the way of completing a project, but the end results and the reactions to it, make the extra time spend, worthwhile.

            One thing that is far from up to par with what I make now is the code. Its structure was incredibly robust, unclear and unoptimized.

            I still use processing for some various projects as it is a simple program where I know most of the extends of it, despite its shortcomings in performance it still is useful in prototyping and smaller use cases.

I only uploaded the game to my itch page years after I made it mostly because I did not yet know the ins and outs of how to upload games at the start of the study. For this I needed to replace a bunch of the assets and music since this was not licensed.
