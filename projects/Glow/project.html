    One of the very first games I made still holds up in my opinion. Although I might be a bit biased.

    In this game you simply have to catch fireflies as a fox.
    While avoiding bats you can set your high score higher and higher with
    the free play mode, while the timed mode tests your speed rather than your accuracy.

            Glow is a game I made for one of the first subjects given at the Creative media and Game Technologies.<br>
            At this time, I did not have much knowledge on many Game Design principles, so if I would remake this game right now,
            I would definitely do things differently in terms of movement, user feedback and the noticeability of the enemy bat.

          <p>
            Yet despite all this whenever I play Glow, I really enjoy it.<br>
            It&#39;s a simple concept, which is something I often strafe for, as simple games appeal to me a lot more then games that
            take months to just understand the various parts of it.

            The game was made in Processing since this was the requirement of the subject, yet I tried to push my own knowledge and skills at many points.
            Like save files and more complex enemy movement.<br>
            These were not requirements, nor were they function that were taught in class, yet I still implemented them.
          </p>
          <img class="media" src="media/Capture3.png" alt="Start menu of game">
          <p>
            I still often see myself doing such above and beyond moves every now and then.<br>
            It does at times get in the way of completing a project, but the end results and the reactions to it, make the extra time spend, worthwhile.

            One thing that is far from up to par with what I make now is the code.<br>
            Its structure was incredibly robust, unclear and unoptimized.
          </p>
          <img class="media" src="media/CaptureCode.png" alt="Code inside Processing">
          <p>
            I still use processing for some various projects as it is a simple program where I know most of the extends of it,
            despite its shortcomings in performance it still is useful in prototyping and smaller use cases.<br>
            <br>
            I only uploaded the game to my itch page years after I made it mostly because I did not yet know the ins and outs of how to upload games
            at the start of the study. For this I needed to replace a bunch of the assets and music since this was not licensed.
